### RNN ###

An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data — data where the order matters.

It’s commonly used in:

🗣️ Speech recognition

✍️ Text generation

🎵 Music prediction

📈 Time-series forecasting

🧠 How does it work?


Unlike traditional neural networks (which treat all inputs independently), RNNs remember past information using a loop inside their architecture. Here's the idea:

Output at time t = f(current input at time t + memory from time t-1)
So, what you input before affects the output now.

📦 **Example:**
Let’s say you’re trying to predict the next word in this sentence:

"I am going to the ___"

A regular neural network would just look at “the”.
But an RNN remembers what came before (“I am going to the”) — so it can guess something like “store”, “gym”, etc.

🔄 **Memory Flow**
At every step:

It takes the current input

Combines it with the previous hidden state (memory)

Outputs a prediction and updates its memory

[Word1] → [RNN] → Output1
           ↓
[Word2] → [RNN] → Output2
           ↓
[Word3] → [RNN] → Output3
(The downward arrow shows memory flowing from one step to the next.)

 **RNN Limitations**
Forgets long-term information (early words are "forgotten" over time)

Training can be slow due to issues like vanishing gradients

To fix this, advanced versions like LSTM and GRU were created, which have better memory handling.
