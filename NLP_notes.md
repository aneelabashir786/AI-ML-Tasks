# NLP (Natural Language Processing)

"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to understand and process human languages either in text or audio form."

Natural Language Processing can be categorized into two components:

1. Natural Language Understanding: It involves interpreting the meaning of the text.

2. Natural Language Generation: It involves generating human-like text based on processed data.
