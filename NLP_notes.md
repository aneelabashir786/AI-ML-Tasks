# NLP (Natural Language Processing)

"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps machines to understand and process human languages either in text or audio form."

Natural Language Processing can be categorized into two components:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: It involves interpreting the meaning of the text.

2. **Natural Language Generation**: It involves generating human-like text based on processed data.

1. Lexical Analysis
   
    It focuses on identifying and processing words (or lexemes) in a text.
   
    Key tasks in Lexical analysis:
   
      **Tokenization:** Process of dividing a text into smaller chunks called tokens. For example the sentence "I love programming" would be tokenized into ["I", "love", "programming"].
   
     ** Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Assigning parts of speech such as noun, verb, adjective to each token in the sentence. This helps us to understand grammatical roles of words in the context.
